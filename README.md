# Upgoated.com

Upgoated.com features the best and most popular content from [voat.co](http://voat.co).

For those who are out of the loop: a bit ago, Reddit announced upvoted.com, an editorial where they post popular content from Reddit. It has been criticized for being what the front page should be; the idea for upgoated.com came from a comment on one of the threads about it here on Voat where someone said something along the lines of "A site dedicated to featuring popular content? We have that - we call it a front page".
